# Code to process Sustainable Farm Networks Forms

## General project overview
To show a GIS representation of member networksâ€™ network members broadly categorised by sector and sustainability theme, with farms located at postcode area level. 

## This repository
This code processes the Excel forms submitted by farms and outputs a cleaned, long format dataset to be used by an Arcgis online map. 

### Inputs
Excel forms, completed by farms. The forms should be consistent in layout but there are tests in the code to check this. The input data is wide and messy. 

### Outputs
Csv, long format dataframe. Cleaned and ready to be used by Arcgis map.
